## UCL Java

Java code I wrote during my undergraduate days in the [Mathematics](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths) and [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) departments at UCL between 2000 and 2004. This was the first time I was formally taught programming, and the first time I tried doing any object oriented programming. I remember falling in love with the concept!

[__\_lib__](\_lib/): Some dependency classes written by the course <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Roberts/" target="_blank">lecturer</a>

[__\_practise__](\_practise/): My testing ground for trying out stuff and learning from other people's code. Who knows [what](\_practise/BackDoorServer.java) you'll find in there...

[__Dictionary__](Dictionary/): A dictionary/database that you build up by typing words into the keyboard.

[__eBook__](eBook/): Another coursework: GUI for reading XML based e-books. I think some initial code was provided to us as a template to build upon.

[__ftpclient__](ftpclient/): Far from complete, but an attempt at building an [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) client with a GUI.

[__Greed__](Greed/): A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle" target="_blank">dice game</a>, set as a first year coursework to practise writing object oriented code.

[__MachineLearning__](MachineLearning/): A few of the Java solutions I coded up to homework problems in my final year [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) learning modules, including single layer [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) clustering and some other stuff.

[__memoapp__](memoapp/): One of the first GUI apps I wrote; basically a memo pad.

[__Nokia__](Nokia/): An incomplete attempt at mimicking some of the UI functionality of my (then) smart new <a href="http://bit.ly/1GL6m9W" target="_blank">Nokia 3310</a> mobile phone :D

[__NumericalAnalysis__](NumericalAnalysis/): Java code I wrote as part of a [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) module I took in the Mathematics department.

[__Parsing__](Parsing/): Another coursework, this time to write a parser. All personal memory of this period in my life has vanished due to the trauma.

[__Pigs__](Pigs/): Some mathematical computations for another [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

[__svmapp__](svmapp/): My final year project. A GUI/front-end to the Java implementation of LIBSVM (which is still <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/" target="_blank">around</a>!) with some rather limited functionality to generate and learn toy classification data and real world data sets that could be loaded provided they were in a very specific format!

[__timetable__](timetable/): Arguably the best app of the bunch; a mobile web app co-developed with Hiren and Rav at the end of year two. This was 2002, when a web app meant Java code that sat on a web server and generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol" target="_blank">WML</a> pages, providing a neat mobile interface to the lecture timetable for all degree programmes in the Computer Science department. Still proud of this one, guys!

[__VSCC__](VSCC/): I think this stood for **V**ery **S**hort **C**ompiler **C**ourse. Enough said.
