<H2>The Image-seg dataset </H2>
<P>The information is a replica of the notes for the segmentation dataset from 
the <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html">UCI 
</A>repository. 
<H3>1. Title: Image Segmentation data </H3>
<H3>2. Source Information </H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Creators: Vision Group, University of Massachusetts 
  <LI>Donor: Vision Group (Carla Brodley, brodley@cs.umass.edu) 
  <LI>Date: November, 1990 </LI></UL>
<H3>3. Past Usage: None yet published </H3>
<H3>4. Relevant Information: </H3>
<P>The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The 
images were handsegmented to create a classification for every pixel. 
<P>Each instance is a 3x3 region. 
<H3>5. Number of Instances: Training data: 210 Test data: 2100 </H3>
<H3>6. Number of Attributes: 19 continuous attributes </H3>
<H3>7. Attribute Information: </H3>
<OL>
  <LI>region-centroid-col: the column of the center pixel of the region. 
  <LI>region-centroid-row: the row of the center pixel of the region. 
  <LI>region-pixel-count: the number of pixels in a region = 9. 
  <LI>short-line-density-5: the results of a line extraction algorithm that 
  counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with low contrast, less 
  than or equal to 5, go through the region. 
  <LI>short-line-density-2: same as short-line-density-5 but counts lines of 
  high contrast, greater than 5. 
  <LI>vedge-mean: measure the contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels in the 
  region. There are 6, the mean and standard deviation are given. This attribute 
  is used as a vertical edge detector. 
  <LI>vegde-sd: (see 6) 
  <LI>hedge-mean: measures the contrast of vertically adjacent pixels. Used for 
  horizontal line detection. 
  <LI>hedge-sd: (see 8). 
  <LI>intensity-mean: the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3 
  <LI>rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value. 
  <LI>rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value. 
  <LI>rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value. 
  <LI>exred-mean: measure the excess red: (2R - (G + B)) 
  <LI>exblue-mean: measure the excess blue: (2B - (G + R)) 
  <LI>exgreen-mean: measure the excess green: (2G - (R + B)) 
  <LI>17. value-mean: 3-d nonlinear transformation of RGB. (Algorithm can be 
  found in Foley and VanDam, Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics) 
  <LI>saturation-mean: (see 17) 
  <LI>hue-mean: (see 17) </LI></OL>
<H3>8. Missing Attribute Values: None </H3>
<H3>9. Class Distribution: </H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Classes: brickface, sky, foliage, cement, window, path, grass. 
  <LI>30 instances per class for training data. 
  <LI>300 instances per class for test data. </LI></UL>
<H3>10. Modifications for Delve</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>The <EM>data</EM> and <EM>test</EM> files were combined and then 
  stratified to ensure equal representation of the output classes in each of the 
  Delve task-instance training sets. 
  <LI>Attribute 3 (region-pixel-count) was deleted since it is a constant for 
  this dataset. </LI></OL></TABLE>
