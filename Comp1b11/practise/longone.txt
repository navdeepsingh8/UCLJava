INSTALLATION

Turn Off Virus Protection
-------------------------
Some virus protection programs can interfere with the 
Microsoft Office 2000 or Microsoft Access 2000 stand-
alone version installation program. If you use a virus 
protection program on your computer, turn it off before 
installing. You can turn the virus protection program 
back on after installation is complete. 

Note -- If your virus-protection program starts 
automatically when you start Windows, you can turn it off 
by restarting Windows while holding down the SHIFT key.

Problems Installing to a Folder Whose Name Contains 
Punctuation Characters
---------------------------------------------------------
Do not use a comma (,), single quotation mark ('), or 
exclamation point (!) in the name of the folder where you 
install Access 2000. It is recommended that you use the 
default folder or use only letters and numbers in folder 
names.

Minimum System Requirements for Access 2000
--------------------------------------------
Microsoft Access 2000 is included in the following 
editions:

* Microsoft Office 2000 Professional
* Microsoft Office 2000 Premium
* Microsoft Office 2000 Developer

To use Access 2000, you need:
* PC with a Pentium 75 MHz or higher processor
* Microsoft Windows 95 or later operating system, or 
  Microsoft Windows NT Workstation operating system 
  version 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later
* For Windows 95 or Windows 98:
    16 MB of RAM for the operating system, plus an 
    additional 8 MB of RAM for Access
* For Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 Service Pack 3 
  or later:
    32 MB of RAM for the operating system, plus an 
    additional 8 MB of RAM for Access
* Available hard-disk space for Access 2000 (Number 
  indicates  typical installation. Your hard-disk usage 
  will vary depending on configuration. Choices made 
  during Custom installation might require more or less 
  hard-disk space): 
    Typical installation: 161 MB
* Available hard-disk space for Office 2000 (Numbers 
  indicate typical installation; your hard-disk usage 
  will vary depending on configuration. Choices made 
  during Custom installation might require more or less 
  hard-disk space.):
    217 MB for Disc 1 (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, 
      Access)
* CD-ROM drive
* VGA or higher resolution monitor; Super VGA recommended
* Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or 
  compatible pointing device

Additional items or services required to use certain 
features:
* 9600 baud modem; 14,400 or higher baud recommended
* Multimedia computer required to access sound and other 
  multimedia effects
* Microsoft Exchange client or Microsoft Outlook 
  required to run Office E-mail
* 8 MB of additional memory required to run Office E-mail
* Some Internet functionality might require Internet 
  access and payment of a separate fee to a service 
  provider

Some Features Switch Automatically to a Different Setting 
During Custom Install
---------------------------------------------------------
During a custom installation, if you set Access to "Not 
Available" and then change certain features of Access to 
something other than "Not Available," some additional 
features will also switch from "Not Available" to the new 
setting you chose.  The features affected are:

Help
Typical Wizards
Additional Wizards
Snapshot Viewer
Database Replication

If you are trying to save space on your disk, try setting 
Access or the individual feature to "Installed on First 
Use" instead. 

Installing Access 2000 on a Network
-----------------------------------
>>> To create an administrative installation point for 
Access 2000:

1. Create a share on a network server for the 
   administrative installation point. The network share 
   must have at least 550 megabytes (MB) of available 
   disk space. 
2. On a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 95/98,
   Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server and that 
   has write permission to the share, connect to the 
   server share. 
3. On the Start menu, click Run, and then click Browse. 
4. On Office Disc 1 in the CD-ROM drive, select setup.exe 
   and click Open. 
5. On the command line following setup.exe, type 
     /A DATA1.MSI 
   and click OK. 
   For example: 
     E:\SETUP.EXE /A DATA1.MSI 
6. When prompted, enter the organization name that you 
   want to define for all users who install Office from 
   this location. 
7. When prompted for the installation location, enter the 
   server and share you created. 

For more information about network and administration 
issues, see the Office Resource Kit Web site at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork

Prompt for CD Key When Installing from an Administrative 
Installation 
-------------------------------------------------------
When you install Access 2000 on your computer from an 
administrative installation on a server, you might be 
prompted for a CD key. This occurs if the system 
administrator who created the administrative 
installation did not enter the CD key.

To solve this problem, ask the system administrator to 
create a new administrative installation and enter the CD 
key in the first dialog box. After this has been done, 
you will not be prompted for the CD key when you install 
Access 2000 from this new administrative installation.
 
Message "File already in use" When Running Access 2000 
from a Network
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Access 2000 from the network, you 
might receive the following message when you open an 
Access database:
   Could not use 'Admin'; file already in use.
This message occurs when a user who has Write permissions 
to the network share opens an Access database; subsequent 
users who have only Read permissions to that share 
receive the message when they attempt to open an Access 
database. 

After you have run the administrative installation of 
Office 2000 or Access 2000, you can prevent this message 
by setting the effective share-level permissions to Read 
permissions for all users who will run Access 2000 from 
the network server. If you are an administrator, you 
might want to create a separate share to the same folder, 
and give any administrators Full Control permissions so 
that they can maintain the files in this folder. However, 
all users should install Office 2000 or Access 2000 from 
the share with Read permissions.  

Installing Access 2000 over an Access 97 Run-time 
Application
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from Access 97 or Office 97 on a
computer where you have installed an Access 97 run-time 
application, the default installation location for Office 
2000 or Access 2000 is:

   C:\Program Files\Office2K

Installing Office 2000 or Access 2000 to this alternate 
default location ensures that you keep the Access 97 
version of Msaccess.exe if it is needed by the run-time 
application.

Unexpected Message during Installation
--------------------------------------
If you get an unexpected message during the installation 
of Office, and you get the same message when you try to 
install Office again, you can create a log file that will 
be useful to Microsoft Product Support Services in 
troubleshooting the problem. Once you create the file, 
you will need to call Microsoft Product Support Services.

>>> To create the log file:
 
1. Click the Start button on the taskbar, and then click 
   Run.
2. In the Open box, type: 
 
      <path>\Setup.exe /L*v c:\Verboselog.txt
 
   where <path> is the location of Setup.exe. For  
   example, if you are installing from a CD-ROM drive, 
   then the text you would type might look like:
 
      d:\Setup.exe /L*v c:\Verboselog.txt
 
3. Click OK.
 
Setup will start again and a log file called 
Verboselog.txt will be created at the root of your C: 
drive.

Installing Access 2000 Without Removing the Beta 2 Build 
of Office 2000 
---------------------------------------------------------
When starting Access 2000, you might receive the 
following message: 

   Required registry information is missing and this 
   application cannot run. Please rerun Setup to correct 
   this problem. 

Or, after a few seconds, the program might quit. 

You might experience either of the above if you installed 
Access 2000 without removing the Beta 2 build (2221b) of 
Microsoft Office 2000.

>>> To solve this problem, do the following to remove the 
Beta 2 build of Office 2000:

1. Click the Start button on the taskbar, point to 
   Settings, and click Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. In the list of installed programs, click Microsoft 
   Office 2000 Premium Edition. (This is the Beta 2 
   version of Office 2000.)
4. Click Add/Remove.
5. Click Remove Office.
6. Click Yes to the prompt confirming that you want to 
   remove.

Access 2000 Shortcut on the Programs Menu Varies 
According to Your Operating System 
---------------------------------------------------------
The Access 2000 shortcut on the Programs menu might have 
the following problems: 

1. It does not self-repair the program.
 
   This problem occurs because your operating system does  
   not support Windows Installer shortcuts. Only the 
   following versions of Microsoft Windows support these 
   shortcuts: 
      * Windows 98
      * Windows 95  with Internet Explorer 4.01, Service 
        Pack 1 and Active Desktop installed
      * Microsoft Windows NT version 4 with 
        Internet Explorer 4.01, Service Pack 1, and 
        Active Desktop installed. 
   Note: If you install Internet Explorer 5 on a computer 
   that has Windows 95 or Windows NT version 4 with 
   Internet Explorer 4.01, Service Pack 1, and Active 
   Desktop installed, it will still support Windows 
   Installer shortcuts. 

2. It does not install the program on first use. 

   This problem occurs because Installed on First Use is  
   not an option for Access in the Selecting Features 
   dialog box during setup. Installed on First Use is not 
   an option because your operating system does not 
   support Windows Installer shortcuts. The operating 
   systems listed under 1. support Windows Installer 
   shortcuts. 

3. It does not display a path on the Shortcut tab of the 
   Properties dialog box for the shortcut. 

   This indicates that the shortcut is a Windows   
   Installer shortcut. Windows Installer shortcuts do not  
   directly reference the path of the shortcut target. 
   Instead, they contain a token that the Windows 
   Installer resolves to the path of the shortcut 
   target. The operating systems listed under item 1
   support Windows Installer shortcuts.

WORKING WITH ACCESS 2000

Displaying Dates with Four-Digit Years 
--------------------------------------
In Access 2000, you can specify that date fields and 
controls display four-digit years. This helps you to 
ensure that the century of a particular date is correct. 
 
On the General tab of the Options dialog box (Tools 
menu), under Use Four-Digit Year Formatting, you can do 
one of the following:
*  Select the This Database check box to display four-
   digit years at the database level (in the current 
   Access database or Access project);
*  Select the All Databases check box to display four-
   digit years at the application level (in all Access 
   databases and Access projects).
Selecting one of these check boxes only changes how dates 
are displayed--it does not change the data itself. These 
options override Format property settings for individual 
fields and controls.

Euro Symbol Not Printed Correctly 
---------------------------------
Although the euro symbol might be displayed correctly in 
Print Preview, it might not print correctly; for example, 
it might not appear at all in the printout, or it might
appear as another character. 

This behavior can occur if you are using a printer font 
that does not support the euro. To resolve this problem, 
first try using a True Type font that does support the 
euro, such as Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman. If 
the euro symbol still isn't printed correctly, change the 
Spool Data Format for your printer from EMF to RAW. 

>>> To change the Spool Data Format for your printer from 
EMF to RAW:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then 
   click Printers.

2. In the Printers dialog box, right-click your printer, 
   and then click Properties.

3. In the <Printer> Properties dialog box, click the 
   Details tab, and then click Spool Settings.

4. In the Spool Data Format box, change the setting from 
   EMF to RAW.

For more information, contact your printer vendor.

Maximum Number of Levels of Nested Forms or Reports
---------------------------------------------------
The maximum number of nested forms or reports is seven.

"Out of Memory" Message on Windows NT Server 4.0 or 
Windows NT Workstation 4.0
---------------------------------------------------------
You might receive an "Out of Memory" message when you 
attempt to save or close a large Access database or 
Access project on Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows 
NT Server 4.0. To prevent this message, install Windows 
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4. 

Enclosing Controls or Using ToolTips in a Rectangle
---------------------------------------------------
In a form or data access page, if you enclose a control 
or use a ToolTip in a rectangle, it might not be 
displayed correctly. To ensure that the control or 
ToolTip is displayed correctly, open the form or data 
access page in Design view, click the rectangle, and then 
click Send To Back on the Format menu.

Using the Image Control in a Data Access Page
---------------------------------------------
In Access 2000, you cannot bind an image control in a 
data access page to an OLE object field in an underlying 
table. However, you can use an image control in a data 
access page to display a different picture for each 
record. In the table, create a Text field that contains 
the URLs of the pictures. Then in the data access page 
based on the table, add an unbound image control, and set 
its ControlSource property to that field.

Print Commands Unavailable When Data Access Page Is 
Selected in Database Window
---------------------------------------------------------
When a data access page is selected in the Database 
window, the Page Setup, Print Preview, and Print commands 
on the File menu are unavailable. You might also receive 
the following message when you try to use the PrintOut 
action in a macro, or when you try to use PrintOut method 
of the DoCmd object in a Visual Basic for Applications 
(VBA) procedure: 
   Run-time error '2046': The command or action 
   'PrintOut' isn't available now.
To use these commands, or to use the PrintOut action or 
method, first make sure that the data access page is 
open.

"Undefined function" Message When Opening Data Access 
Page
--------------------------------------------------------
In a data access page, if you use a function that is not 
available outside of Access, you receive the following 
message when you open the page in Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 5:
   Undefined function '<FunctionName>' in expression.
For example, you receive this message if your data access 
page is based on a query in which an expression contains 
Nz, EuroConvert, Eval, or a user-defined function. You 
also receive this message if you use a function that is 
not available outside of Access in a control on a data 
access page. The message does not appear when you open 
the data access page in Access.

Preventing Unauthorized Access from Scripts in Data 
Access Pages
---------------------------------------------------------
You can provide security against scripts that run in a 
data access page and attempt to access databases on 
servers other than the one the page was downloaded from.  
For more information, see "Creating Secure Data Access 
Pages" (DAP Security.doc) and "Deploying Data Access 
Pages on the Internet" (DAP Internet Deployment.doc) in 
the Appendixes folder on the companion CD-ROM to the 
Microsoft Office 2000/Visual Basic Programmer's Guide. 
You can also obtain these documents on Microsoft's web 
site at the Office Developer's Forum. You can find more 
information in Chapter 18, "Securing Access Databases," 
in the Microsoft Office 2000/Visual Basic Programmer's 
Guide.  

Color Palette in Data Access Pages When Display Is 
Configured to Use 256 Colors
---------------------------------------------------------
Data access pages might not be displayed correctly on 
computers where the Color Palette of the video display is 
set to 256 Color or less. If you need to ensure that data 
access pages appear correctly on 16-color or 256-color 
video displays, limit the colors that you use to those 
included in the Windows 16-color palette.

      		R	G	B
   Black		00	00	00
   White		FF	FF	FF
   Dark Gray	80	80	80
   Light Gray	C0	C0	C0
   Dark Red	      80	00	00
   Red		FF	00	00
   Mustard	      80	80	80
   Yellow	      FF	FF	00
   Dark Green	00	80	00
   Light Green	00	FF	00
   Teal		00	80	80
   Light Blue	00	FF	FF
   Dark Blue	00	00	80
   Blue		00	00	FF
   Purple	      80	00	80
   Lavender	      FF	00	FF

Problems When Using Taskbar Buttons To Navigate Between 
Multiple Data Access Pages
---------------------------------------------------------
If you have installed the Active Desktop, and in Internet 
Explorer you have cleared the check box to launch 
browser windows in a separate process, you might 
experience problems if you open multiple data access 
pages and move between them by clicking their 
corresponding taskbar buttons. For example, if you open 
one data access page and you then open a second data 
access page in another window, in some cases you might 
not be able to navigate back to the first page until you 
have closed the second page. To prevent this behavior, 
start Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the 
Tools menu, and on the Advanced tab, select the check box 
to launch browser windows in a separate process.  

Display Problems When Scrolling Through the Employees 
Form in Northwind
---------------------------------------------------------
In the Northwind sample database, the display might 
flicker when you scroll through the records in the 
Employees form. 

>>> To prevent this problem: 

1. In Windows Control Panel, double-click the Display 
   icon, and then click the Settings tab.

2. In the Color Palette box, click a setting with more 
   than 256 colors.

   NOTE: If your system does not support more than 256 
   colors, you will not be able to select a higher 
   setting.

Using Northwind Sample Database Located on a Read-only 
Share
---------------------------------------------------------
If you open a copy of the Northwind sample database that 
is located on a read-only share, you might receive the 
following message:
   There were 5 errors fixing your data access page    
   connections.  Some pages may not function as expected.
When you first open the Northwind sample database, it 
attempts to fix the connections of its data access pages. 
This process checks the file attribute of Northwind. If 
the attribute is read-only, the process cannot fix the 
connections, and execution stops without error. However, 
the fixup process does not check the permissions of the 
network share where Northwind is located; if the share is 
read-only, the connections cannot be fixed.  

This behavior may occur in any database containing 
similar code that fixes data access page connections. If 
you are deploying Northwind or any database with a 
similar fixup process on a read-only share, you can avoid 
this problem by setting the file attribute of the 
database to read-only. You can also prevent the fixup 
process from running by pressing the SHIFT key while you 
open the Northwind sample database. However, this might 
mean that the data access pages will not function as 
expected. 

Obtaining Microsoft Office 2000 Proofing Tools
----------------------------------------------
Microsoft Office 2000 Proofing Tools is an add-in package 
for Office 2000 that contains all the language tools 
Microsoft makes for more than 30 languages. It can be 
obtained from a licensed reseller. The part and SKU 
numbers listed in Help are incorrect. See 
http://www.microsoft.com/office for more information on 
obtaining Office 2000 Proofing Tools. 

WebBot Components Not in Office 2000 Developer
----------------------------------------------
Some topics in Help erroneously state that Microsoft 
Office WebBot components and associated white papers are 
available in Microsoft Office 2000 Developer. WebBot 
components are not available in this release of Office 
2000 Developer. 

Colors May Not Display Correctly on 256-color Monitors
-------------------------------------------------------
After you view pop-up windows in Help topics, colors for 
some elements may no longer display correctly on 256-
color monitors. For example, the following elements may 
appear differently on the screen after you view pop-up 
windows:
* Bitmaps
* Pictures embedded in files
* Office Assistant
* Hyperlinks

To fix the display problem, change the color palette for 
your monitor.

>>> To change the color palette:

1. Click Start on the Windows taskbar, point to Settings, 
   and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Display icon.

3. On the Settings tab, select an option other than 256 
   colors. Microsoft recommends that you choose more than 
   256 colors, if such an option is available.

MICROSOFT JET

ANSI-92 Compliant SQL
---------------------
The Microsoft Jet 4.0 database engine supports two forms 
of SQL syntax; one mode supports the same Jet SQL 
commands used in previous versions of Access, and another 
new mode supports new Jet SQL commands and syntax that 
are more compliant with the ANSI SQL-92 standard. The 
mode that supports the SQL commands used in previous 
versions of Access is the only mode that is available 
through the Access 2000 user interface. The newer SQL 
syntax is currently available only in Visual Basic for 
Applications (VBA) procedures that use ActiveX Data 
Objects (ADO) and the Microsoft OLE DB provider for Jet 
version 4.x. When you use the OLE DB provider for Jet 
version 4.x through ADO, you can execute temporary 
queries (i.e., queries that are not stored and are used 
as part of a recordset's source by using 
Connection.Execute or Command.Execute) or create stored 
queries (by using the new CREATE VIEW, CREATE PROCEDURE 
syntax).  

Although you can use ADO and the OLE DB provider for Jet 
4.x to access all stored queries created through the OLE 
DB provider for Jet 4.x, they are not visible in the 
Access user interface. For example, you cannot set the 
RecordSource property of a form to a query created with 
the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Extensions for DDL and 
Security (ADOX) version 2.1 object library, and you 
cannot import a query created with ADOX into another 
database. However, you can still use ADO code to run 
stored queries created by using ADOX.

If you try to save a new query and receive a message that 
the name you entered already exists for another object, 
try using a different name. An ANSI-92 query with the 
same name might already exist, but might not be visible 
in the Objects list in the Database window. 

For more information about ANSI-92 compliant SQL with the 
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet version 4.x, type 
COMPARISON OF JET SQL AND ANSI SQL in the Office 
Assistant or on the Answer Wizard tab in the Help window, 
and then click Search. 

COUNTER and IDENTITY 
---------------------
COUNTER and IDENTITY are Microsoft Jet SQL reserved 
words, but they are not Jet SQL data types. For more 
information about the Microsoft Jet data types, see the 
Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer's Guide 
published by Microsoft Press.

CONVERSION AND COMPATIBILITY

Compatibility Library
----------------------
Access 2000 does not ship with the DAO 2.5/3.x 
compatibility library. If you attempt to convert an 
Access database in which the code contains older versions 
of DAO objects, methods, and properties that depend on 
the DAO 2.5/3.x compatibility library, you might receive 
a message that there were compilation errors during the 
conversion of the database. If the DAO 2.5/3.x 
compatibility library that shipped with a previous 
version of Access still exists on your computer, you can 
create a reference to it and then use it. However, before 
you convert an Access database on a computer where the 
DAO 2.5/3.x compatibility library does not exist, you 
must update the code so that it does not depend on 
that library. 

Turning On Name AutoCorrect in a Converted Access 
Database
--------------------------------------------------------
By default, Name AutoCorrect is not turned on in a 
converted Access database. To turn on Name AutoCorrect, 
click Options on the Tools menu, click the General tab, 
and under Name AutoCorrect, select the appropriate check 
boxes. Then open each table, query, form, and report in 
Design view, save the object, and close it.

For more information, type NAME AUTOCORRECT in the 
Office Assistant or on the Answer Wizard tab in the Help 
window, and then click Search, or see the Microsoft 
Office Update Web site at 
http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/default.htm.

MICROSOFT ACCESS PROJECTS 

Unexpected Behavior When SQL Statement Output Contains 
Two Fields with Same Name
---------------------------------------------------------
In an Access project (*.adp), you might see unexpected 
results when you use an SQL statement whose output 
contains two or more fields with the same name. For 
example, you might see unexpected behavior when you 
work with a view that is based on two tables and that 
contains two fields that have the same name but are 
located in different tables. To prevent unexpected 
behavior, specify an alias for one of the fields to 
ensure that every field in the output has a unique name. 

Can't Refer to Controls in Forms or Reports in Aggregate 
Functions
---------------------------------------------------------
In an Access project, your aggregate functions cannot use 
references to controls in objects such as forms or 
reports. For example, you cannot use the following 
expression:
   =DLookUp("CategoryName";"Categories";"CategoryID =   
      Reports!Report1!CategoryID")

Rebooting Your Computer after Installing Microsoft Data 
Engine (MSDE)
--------------------------------------------------------
To ensure that Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) runs 
correctly, you must reboot your computer after installing 
MSDE. If you do not reboot your computer, you might see 
unexpected behavior while using MSDE. For example, if you 
attempt to create a new publication from an Access 
project, you might receive a message that one of the 
library files needed to run this application cannot be 
found (error 1157). For more information about MSDE, type 
WORK WITH A MICROSOFT ACCESS PROJECT in the Office 
Assistant or on the Answer Wizard tab in the Help window, 
and then click Search.

"Order by clause may not be used in this query type" When 
View Has TOP Clause
---------------------------------------------------------
When you save a view that contains a TOP clause and an 
ORDER BY clause, you might receive the message "Order by 
clause may not be used in this query type." However, when 
you run the query, it returns the correct results and no 
message appears.

Incoming Named Pipe Connections Not Supported on Windows 
95 or Windows 98
---------------------------------------------------------
You cannot connect to a remote Microsoft Data Engine 
(MSDE) or SQL Server 7.0 Desktop database located on a 
Windows 95 or Windows 98 computer unless you use a 
protocol other than Named Pipes. These platforms do not 
support incoming Named Pipe connections. To connect to 
the database, run the Client Network Utility 
Cliconfg.exe, which is located in the Windows\System 
folder on the client computer; add a server alias that 
specifies the remote server you need to connect to, and 
select TCP/IP as the default network library. 

Microsoft Data Engine Rules for Naming Identifiers
--------------------------------------------------
You might see unexpected behavior if you are using a 
Microsoft Database Engine (MSDE) database whose name does 
not conform to the following rules for identifiers:

1. The first character must be one of the following:
 
   A letter as defined by the Unicode Standard 2.0. The 
   Unicode definition of letters includes Latin   
   characters a-z and A-Z, in addition to letter 
   characters from other languages. 

   The _ (underscore), @ (at sign), or # (number sign) 
   symbol. Certain symbols at the beginning of an 
   identifier have special meaning in MSDE. An identifier 
   beginning with @ denotes a local variable or 
   parameter. An identifier beginning with # denotes a 
   temporary table or procedure. An identifier beginning 
   with double number signs (##) denotes a global 
   temporary object. 

   Some Transact-SQL functions have names that start with 
   double at signs (@@). To avoid confusion with these 
   functions, it is recommended that you do not use names 
   that start with @@. 

2. Subsequent characters can be: 

   Letters as defined in the Unicode Standard 2.0. 

   Decimal numbers from either Basic Latin or other  
   national scripts. 

   The @, $, #, or _ symbols. 

   The identifier must not be a Transact-SQL reserved 
   word. 

   MSDE reserves both the uppercase and lowercase 
   versions of reserved words. 

3. Embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed.

OFFICE WEB COMPONENT ISSUES

Editing a Formula in a Cell That Contains a Hyperlink
-----------------------------------------------------
The Help topic "Change a formula in a spreadsheet" 
incorrectly states that if a cell you want to edit 
contains a hyperlink, you should click a cell next to 
that cell, use an arrow key to select the cell you want 
to edit, and then click the cell once. Clicking the cell 
once will take you to the page that the hyperlink links 
to. Instead, once you have used an arrow key to select 
the cell, press F2 to begin editing.

ASC Worksheet Function Not Supported by the Spreadsheet 
Component
--------------------------------------------------------
The Help topic "Microsoft Excel worksheet functions not 
available in Web spreadsheet" does not list the ASC 
worksheet function, but this function is not available in 
spreadsheets published on the Web. If you publish a 
worksheet that contains the ASC function, the function is 
replaced with its resultant value.

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ado

Functions Broken Because Of vbDatabaseCompare
---------------------------------------------
The InStrRev, Split, Filter, and Replace functions may 
fail because of errors resulting from the use of 
vbDatabaseCompare. The workaround is to explicitly 
specify a comparison argument, for example, 
vbBinaryCompare or vbTextCompare.

DataAccessPage Object, DataAccessPages Collection Code 
Example
---------------------------------------------------------
In the second example, the line 

   Dim Dap As DataAccessPage 

should be replaced with the line 

   Dim Dap As AccessObject

Context Property (CommandBar Object)
------------------------------------
This property returns an empty string and is otherwise 
unsupported.

Chart Workspace Object Model (Office Web Components)
----------------------------------------------------
The diagram for the Chart Workspace object model is 
incorrect. The WCPlotArea, WCScaling, and 
WCSeriesCollection objects and all their associated 
objects should appear under the WCCharts object, not the 
ChartSpace object as shown in the documentation. Also, 
the WCCharts object should also contain a WCTitle object.

SelectionChange Event (Office Web Components)
---------------------------------------------
In the SelectionChange event handler for the Spreadsheet 
component, all properties of the SpreadsheetEventInfo 
object are invalid for this event with the exception of 
the Range property.

GetValue Method (Office Web Components)
---------------------------------------
The Dimension argument can also be either 
chErrorBarPlusValues or chErrorBarMinusValues for 
returning values for custom WCErrorBars objects.

HTMLData Property (Office Web Components)
-----------------------------------------
This property is read/write for Spreadsheet objects and 
read-only for Range objects.

KeyChar Property (Office Web Components)
----------------------------------------
The KeyChar property returns an empty string for the 
KeyDown and KeyUp events.

RecordsetLabel Property (Office Web Components)
-----------------------------------------------
The RecordsetLabel property of the 
RecordNavigationControl object is parsed for specific 
information to use when displaying the label. For 
example, the tags |0, |1, and |2 are replaced with record 
numbers when displayed. If the RecordsetLabel property 
equals the string "Categories |0 of |2;Categories |0-|1 
of |2", a label for a banded page might read "Categories 
1-5 of 8", and a label for an unbanded page might read 
"Categories 1 of 8".

Value Property (Office Web Components)
--------------------------------------
The Remarks section for the Value property states that if 
the specified range contains more than one cell, this 
property returns an array containing the values for all 
the cells. This is incorrect: The property only returns 
the value of the active cell in the range.

Default Language for Visual Basic Editor and Microsoft 
Script Editor
---------------------------------------------------------
The Visual Basic Editor and Microsoft Script Editor 
default to English if the current system code page does 
not support the user interface language.

New Properties (VBA)
--------------------
The following are new properties that apply to class 
modules in standalone projects:

* Instancing Property

  Sets a value that specifies whether you can create 
  instances of a public class outside a project, and if 
  so, how they will behave. Not available at run time.

  Settings

  The Instancing property has these settings:

  Setting    Description

  1          Private (default). Other applications are  
             not allowed access to type library 
             information about the class and cannot 
             create instances of it. Private objects are 
             only for use within your component. The 
             Instancing property default varies depending 
             on the project type. Private is the default 
             only for class modules in standalone 
             projects.

  2          PublicNotCreatable. Other applications can 
             use objects of this class only if your 
             component creates the objects first. Other 
             applications cannot use the CreateObject 
             function or the New operator to create 
             objects from the class.

* Name Property

  Returns the name used in code to identify a class. 
  Read-only at run time.

  Syntax

  object.Name

  The object placeholder represents an object expression 
  that evaluates to a class.

  Remarks

  An object's Name property must start with a letter and 
  can be a maximum of 40 characters long. It can include 
  numbers and underline (_) characters but can't include 
  punctuation or spaces. Although the Name property 
  setting can be a keyword, property name, or the name of 
  another object, this can create conflicts in your code.

Use F3 to Find Next Text Occurrence in the Code Window
------------------------------------------------------
Press F3 to find the next occurrence of previously 
specified search text in the code window, not SHIFT+F4 as 
stated in the documentation.

System Event Notification System
--------------------------------
For programmers writing to the System Event Notification 
System (SENS) and the IEventSubscription and IEventSystem 
interfaces, please see the documentation for these 
interfaces at MSDN Online (http://msdn.microsoft.com) or 
a version of the Platform SDK later than that which 
shipped with the April MSDN.

HTML Reference Documentation
----------------------------
The latest HTML, DHTML, and CSS documentation is 
available online from MSDN Online at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com.

Internet Explorer Versions and Editing HTML
-------------------------------------------
Selection works differently in Microsoft Script Editor 
for sited elements depending on what version of Internet 
Explorer you have installed. A sited element is any 
element that has a height or width, such as BUTTON. 

With Internet Explorer 4.01, selection for sited elements 
works as follows:

- The first click on an element allows you to edit the 
text within the element.
- The second click on an element selects the element.
- Double-clicking an element selects the text block 
within the element.

With Internet Explorer 5.0, selection for sited elements 
works as follows:

- The first click on an element selects the element.
- The second click on an element allows you to edit the 
text within the element.
- Double-clicking the element brings up the source code 
for the element.

Note: Selection for tables in Internet Explorer 5.0 is 
the same as it was in Internet Explorer 4.01.

Also, Internet Explorer 5.0 preserves white space better 
than Internet Explorer 4.01 when switching between views 
in the editor.

"Topic Not Found" Topic (Microsoft Script Editor)
-------------------------------------------------
You do not need the MSDN Library or MSDN Library CD to 
view help topics for Microsoft Script Editor. If you 
encounter the "Topic Not Found" topic, try one of the 
following:

- Reinstall Microsoft Script Editor from the Microsoft 
Office setup.
- Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the CD-ROM drive.

"Property cannot be set" When Changing ControlSource on 
Data Access Page
---------------------------------------------------------
If you have code in your data access page that attempts 
to change the ControlSource property of a control, you 
might receive the following message:
   Run-time error '26072': Property cannot be set in this 
   mode.
You can only change the ControlSource property with 
inline code at page load time.

MULTILINGUAL ISSUES

General
-------

Code Page of Client Machine Must Match Code Page of 
Server
---------------------------------------------------------
For SQL Server international applications, you may see 
unexpected behavior if the system code page of client 
machines doesn't match the character set of Microsoft SQL 
Server on the server. On the client, the system code page 
is the character set that is used by the language 
specified in operating system; if you are running Windows 
NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, this is the 
Default Locale. On the server, the character set is 
specified during SQL Server installation.  

In an Access project (*.adp), result sets containing ANSI 
text fields are not displayed correctly if the system 
code page of the client computer does not match the 
character set of the SQL Server to which the client is 
connected. This problem does not occur for data that is 
stored as Unicode on the server. 
 
Create Registry Keys To Temporarily Enforce a Code Page 
During Conversion
---------------------------------------------------------
Access normally uses the code page of the operating 
system to convert previous-version databases to Access 
2000. If you are converting an Access database in which 
the code page is different from that of the operating 
system on your computer, create a ForceCP entry in the 
Windows Registry. 

The ForceCP registry entry temporarily enforces the code 
page that corresponds to the language you are using. The 
code page is the character set that is used by the 
language specified in the Regional Settings of the 
operating system. You might need to create a ForceCP 
registry entry if you don't have the necessary language 
version of the operating system, or if the database is in 
a language for which the previous version of Access had 
no sort order support. For example, previous versions of 
Access did not support a sort order for Vietnamese, 
Farsi, or a Baltic languages (Estonian, Latvian, or 
Lithuanian); therefore, the sort order for databases in 
these languages was General. The ForceCP registry entry 
allows non-Western data in your tables to be converted 
correctly. WARNING: The ForceCP registry entry affects 
only tables and queries; non-Western characters in forms, 
reports, macros, and modules might not be converted 
correctly if the code page of the Access database doesn't 
match the code page specified by the operating system. 

The full subkey you should add will be one of the 
following:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0
         \Engines\Jet3.x\ForceCP
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0
         \Engines\Jet2.x\ForceCP

If you are converting a database that was created in 
Access 95 or later, create the new string value in the 
Jet3.x subkey with the name; if you are converting a 
database that was created in Access 2.0 or earlier, 
create the new string value in the Jet2.x subkey. In 
either case, the name of the entry is "ForceCP"; the 
value is the number of the code page that you want to 
use. For example, the number of the code page for Windows 
Baltic Rim is 1257.

To allow the registry entry to take effect, quit 
Access and restart it. After you have converted the 
Access database, delete the registry entry so that 
Access can resume its normal mode of operation.

For a more information about customizing Windows Registry 
settings for Microsoft Jet, type CUSTOMIZE WINDOWS 
REGISTRY SETTINGS in the Office Assistant or on the 
Answer Wizard tab in the Help window, and then click 
Search.
 
Error Messages Appear in Wrong Language When Using 
Language Pack
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are using the Office 2000 Language Pack, error 
messages might appear in the wrong language. To ensure 
that error messages appear in the appropriate language, 
first back up the U.S. versions of the files Msjint40.dll 
and Mswstr10.dll that are located in your \Windows\System 
folder. Then copy the localized versions of the files to 
your \Windows\System folder.

You can find localized versions of these files on the 
Language Pack CD in the following folder:	

	\Extras\Jet\<language>

where <language> is the three-letter abbreviation for the 
language that you are using.

Key Assignment Macros in AutoKeys Macro Group No Longer 
Work
---------------------------------------------------------
If you convert an Access database that was created in 
German, Spanish, Brazilian, or Portuguese versions of 
Access, key assignment macros in the AutoKeys macro group 
might no longer work. In Access 2000, change the name of 
the AutoKeys macro group to the English word "AutoKeys" 
to enable the key assignment macros. This permits the key 
assignment macros in your database to work as expected in 
any language version of Access 2000.  

Message "Database 'msdb' cannot be opened"
------------------------------------------
You might receive the message "Database 'msdb' cannot be 
opened" when using database utilities, database security, 
or replication in an Access project that is connected to 
a Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) database. This message 
might occur if you selected a character set besides the 
default 1252/ISO character set in the Character Set/Sort 
Order/Unicode Collation dialog box during MSDE 
installation, and you also accepted the other default 
settings. The default locale identifier is General 
Unicode, the Case-sensitive, Width-insensitive and Kana-
insensitive check boxes are selected by default. 

>>> To correct the problem with the msdb database:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to 
   MSDE, and click Service Manager.

2. Stop the MSDE service. 

3. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then 
   click MS-DOS Prompt.

4. Change to the \Binn directory of MSDE; by default,
   this directory is C:\MSSQL7\Binn.

5. Type the following in the case shown:

      sqlservr -c -T1806

6. Repeat steps 3 and 4.

7. In the second MS-DOS Prompt window, type the 
   following in the case shown:

      osql -Usa -P
      use msdb
      checkpoint
      go
      shutdown
      go

   Note that the checkpoint command generates a warning 
   that the sort order in the database differs from the 
   server sort order.

8. Close the MS-DOS Prompt windows, and restart the MSDE 
   service.

Cannot Log On As "Administrator" When Modifying Page 
Connection String
---------------------------------------------------------
In non-English versions of Access, if you attempt to 
establish a connection between a database and a data 
access page, and you log on to the database with the user 
name "Administrator," you receive the message "Not a 
valid account name or password." To modify the connection 
string of a data access page, use the English word 
"Admin" as the logon name.

Non-U.S., Non-East Asian: Northwind SQL Project Not 
Advertised in the User Interface
---------------------------------------------------------
In non-U.S. English and non-East Asian versions of 
Access, the Northwind SQL Project File is not advertised 
in the user interface. You must run the Office 2000 
installation program or Access 2000 installation program, 
and change the installation setting of the Northwind SQL 
Project File from "Installed on First Use" to "Run from 
My Computer."

Hyperlink to Database Object Doesn't Work with Object 
Type Name in Local Language
---------------------------------------------------------
If you click a hyperlink whose subaddress specifies a 
database object, you might receive a message that Access 
is not able to follow the hyperlink. This problem occurs 
if the object type string is in the local language 
instead of in English. For example, you might receive the 
message if the subaddress is "#LocalizedReportString 
<ReportName>" instead of the English string "#Report 
<ReportName>". When you create a hyperlink that points to 
a database object, you can prevent this message by 
clicking Object in This Database in the Insert Hyperlink 
or Edit Hyperlink dialog box. When you select an object 
from the list of objects in the database, Access 
automatically creates a hyperlink whose object type 
string is in English.

Right-to-Left Languages
-----------------------

Printing in Right-to-Left Languages
-----------------------------------
Certain printers will require updated printer drivers. 
Please contact your printer manufacturer if you encounter 
problems printing.

Expression Builder Limitations for Right-to-Left 
Languages
---------------------------------------------------------
You can enter and edit expressions directly in the 
Properties window of controls or you can use the 
Expression Builder. If you have mixed right-to-left and 
Latin text in your expressions, use the Properties 
window. If you use the Expression Builder, your mixed-
text expressions will be correctly transferred to the 
Properties window, but the appearance of mixed text might 
be confusing.

Hijri Database Calendar in Sample Applications
----------------------------------------------
Sample applications such as the Northwind database expect 
the database calendar to be Gregorian.  Because the 
sample application contains hard-coded date constants 
that are not valid Hijri dates, running the sample 
application with the database calendar set to Hijri 
(Tools.Startup.Use Hijri Calendar) is not recommended.

Input Mask Restrictions for Right-to-Left Languages
---------------------------------------------------
Input masks that you create for data entry will operate 
as expected only when Latin text and numbers are entered.  
Right-to-left text entered in a field with an input mask 
will produce undesirable masked input behavior.

Hijri Calendar Support in Data Access Pages and Web Pages
---------------------------------------------------------
All data-bound controls on data access pages and Web 
pages can display date values in Gregorian calendar 
format. Date display in Hijri calendar format is also 
possible if certain controls are used. 

* Office Web Controls (WebCalc, PivotList and WebChart) 
  support date display in Hijri calendar format. The 
  calendar used for date display is determined by the 
  Calendar Type setting on the Date tab of the Regional 
  Settings Properties dialog box (available through 
  Windows Control Panel).

* Most other controls used for data binding, such as the 
  intrinsic textbox and label controls of Internet 
  Explorer 5, display date values only in Gregorian 
  calendar format.

Viewing Arabic Data in Microsoft Replication Conflict 
Viewer and Import/Export Wizards
---------------------------------------------------------
To view sample information and certain other Arabic data 
correctly when running the Microsoft Replication Conflict 
Viewer and the Import/Export Wizards, the locale setting 
on the Regional Settings tab of the Regional Settings 
dialog box (available through the Windows Control Panel) 
must be Arabic (Saudi Arabia). 

East Asian Languages
--------------------

Possible Display Problems When Using Multiple Asian Fonts
---------------------------------------------------------
If you install multiple Asian fonts on non-Asian versions 
of Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 
NT Workstation 4.0, you might experience display 
problems, such as very large text, blank text, or very 
large blank areas occurring in Access 2000 or in Windows 
NT. This is a known problem in Windows NT version 4.0 
Service Pack 4 that will be fixed in an upcoming Service 
Pack release for Windows NT version 4.0.
